Overall, I would say that my website turned out to be decent, considering that my rough draft needed a lot of revising and editing. From my rough draft, I was able to make changes such as the fonts, font sizes, font colors, text alignment, adding another page, uploading a profile picture, and rearranging the layout of my page overall.
If I had more time to work on the project, I would change the color scheme of my website. I noticed that the white background color was too white compared to the blue bars on the top and gray bar on the side, leaving the information in the middle appearing “empty”. I also thought that my resume page was too long so in the future, I would try to condense it more by changing the layout of the sections or working with different fonts or font sizes. One other thing that I would change is the navigation bar (“Home”, “Click here to download resume”, “Resume). I felt that they were too generic and due to time constraint, I wasn’t able to invest too much time into making them look nice. In the future, I would add a padding and a border around the texts to make it look neat.
